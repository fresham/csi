  question: Is Microsoft Office included in this plan?
  answer: No. Unfortunately Microsoft Office is not included through MSDN. If you want Office, you will have to purchase it from either a retail store, or through Microsoft's web page. You may also want to consider <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Open Office</a>. Open Office is an open source product that is available for free download and provides a fully functional office suite.
